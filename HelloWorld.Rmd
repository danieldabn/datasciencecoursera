## This is a R Markdown

This document is a R Markdown uploaded to GitHub so I can share it with other data scientists easily. 

Is important to remember the *cheatcodes* for **highlighting** texts.

Also, in this type of documents you can put **chunks of code** plus text, to keep track of comments and instructions. 

Some chunks are the followings:


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
